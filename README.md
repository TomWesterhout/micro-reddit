This project is part of the Databases and Active Record chapter of the Ruby on Rails section of The Odin Project.

The task was to setup the back-end of a micro version of the popular Reddit application in Ruby on Rails.

By creating a User, Comment and Post model and setting up the right associations and validations, the application makes it possible to create users, let users create posts and let other users comment on the created posts.

Although commenting on comments wasn't a requirement in this project, I've added a text document which contains the data model of the current application and also a data model of the application if it would allow commenting on comments via a polymorphic association.
